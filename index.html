<br>
<br>As of this writing, SushiSwap sits at number six on the DeFi Pulse leaderboard. It hosts an aggregate of $3.69 billion of collateralized assets. However the biggest competitor Sushiswap is fifth on the list and holds $3.97 billion.
<br>
<br>
<br>The DEX has a large part of its success to savvy and strategic thinking. Through introducing superior features to their rivals, SushiSwap reached more than $1.6 billion in liquid assets in just one month. But since the features were only temporary as was the platform's popularity. Certain controversies did not aid either and SushiSwap changed from being DeFi's top project to the most unpopular.
<br>
<br>
<br>This meant that nobody wanted to alter this protocol over the course of months. It wasn't until the new developers started developing SushiSwap to make the swap more secure that it was able to gain the trust of the community.
<br>
<br>
<br>SushiSwap Exchange SushiSwap Exchange allows users to swap any ERC20 token for any other token ERC20 using automatic liquidity pools. The Swap page is an example. It was only when new developers started developing SushiSwap when the swap was able to win back the trust of the community.&nbsp;</p>
